      About Me: Hi! My name is Zachary Yuri Berunio, and I’m a working student. I’m currently a 2nd-year
      Computer Science student, balancing my studies with a full-time job as a call center agent. It’s been a
      challenging situation, but rewarding experience as I get to develop both my technical skills in school
      and my communication skills at work.
